/**
 * Holds game events that cannot be sent yet.
 *
 * <p>The connector used to drop every event produced while the socket was down or before
 * {@code identifyResponse} arrived: a chat message, death or connect during a Takaro outage was
 * lost permanently (F13). Events are now parked here and flushed once the connection is
 * identified.
 *
 * <p>The queue is bounded and drops the OLDEST event when full, so a long outage costs the
 * start of the backlog rather than unbounded memory, and the number dropped is counted so it
 * can be logged honestly rather than hidden.
 *
 * <p>No Hytale imports, so this is unit-testable without the server jar.
